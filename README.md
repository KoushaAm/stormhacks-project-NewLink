# SFUConnect 

Imagine arriving at a new university, in a new country, where everything feels unfamiliar. The sights, the sounds, even the way people interact is different. Now imagine having a friend who understands exactly what you’re going through, someone who shares your interests and is ready to help you navigate this new chapter. Welcome to SFUConnect – the ultimate social compass for international students at SFU.

As a new student, you might wonder what to wear, how to ask questions, or simply how to make friends. SFUConnect bridges these gaps by connecting you with fellow students who share your interests and are excited to meet you.
